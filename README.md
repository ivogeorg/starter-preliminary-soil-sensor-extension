# CPE 1040 - Introduction to Computer Engeneering

## Assignment: Migrating micro:bit Programming from Blocks to JavaScript (Makeup)

### 1. Summary

This assignment asks you to go complete the Final Project for the [Intro to CS course with Blocks](https://makecode.microbit.org/courses/csintro) for the micro:bit, in JavaScript, following the [criteria](#criteria) below. This assignment is submitted through Github.

### 2. Criteira

#### 2.1 Requirements
1. The file should have a name and the `.js` file extension.
2. A project [description](#description) should be included in this [README](README.md) file.	

#### 2.2 Code quality
1. The program should have proper indentation.
2. Every block of code should contain inline comments, briefly describing its purpose and functionality.	
3. The program should have good structure, with asynchronous and synchronous code blocks properly differentiated. **Note:** You cannot have more than one `forever` loop.
4. Variables should be named in either of the following styles:
   1. `variable_name_of_underscore_delimited_lower_case_words`, or
   2. `variableNameInCamelCase`

#### 2.3 JavaScript
1. Variables should be declared with [full static data types](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/types).	
2. Programmatic functionality should be encapsulated in [functions](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/functions), and, optionally for **bonus** points, [classes](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/classes).	
3. Functions in JavaScript are [1st class objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function). All event constructs like `onButtonPressed` and `onGesture` take functions as arguments.	
4. A maximum variety of JS language constructs (loops, conditionals, various operators, encapsulations, event handling, etc) should be used.

#### 2.4 micro:bit			
1. Use of buttons	and/or guestures.
2. Sensible display update.
3. Non-trivial functionality.	
4. Control complexity.

7. [Github markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### JavaScript

1. Technically, the language which is used side-by-side with Blocks in the Makecode environment is a subset of [TypeScript](https://makecode.com/language), which itself is a superset of JavaScript (technically, [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#Title)), with some JS features not implemented in Makecode.

2. The limited [JavaScript mini-tutorial](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript) in Makecode. Make sure you read it but that can't be your only reference.

3. Official [TypeScript documentation]():
   1. TypeScript in 5 min [tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html). _**Highly recommended!** You will need to [download](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) and install an integrated development envinronment (IDE). The two that I recommend are Visual Studio Code from Microsoft and WebStorm from JetBrains._
   2. The full documentation and reference is under _Handbook_. Bear in mind that you are drinking from the hose. Don't be surprised if not everything is presented in a strictly incremental manner.
   
4. In-browser TypeScript [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html). Note that micro:bit specific code will not run, but you can still play. _Start making the distinction between a generic multi-purpose programming language (TypeScript) and functionality (packages, libraries, objects, etc.) that is specific to a particular device (micro:bit), though written in the same programming language._

5. A pretty good and very palatable JS tutorial with in-browser coding, by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

6. Extensive and detailed [JS tutorial](https://javascript.info/), with some advanced material thrown in. _**I like this one!**

7. The most authoritative JS resource on the Web, including tutorials and reference, by [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
